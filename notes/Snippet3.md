### Question:
modify get_all_invoices such that it will accept filters as needed. This filters argument should be optional

### Answer:
I'll modify the `get_all_invoices` method to accept an optional filters argument, similar to how the `search_invoices` method works. This will make the method more flexible while maintaining backward compatibility.

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None):
    """Get all invoices with related data
    
    Args:
        filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions to apply. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        
        if filters:
            for filter_condition in filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

This modification:

1. Adds an optional `filters` parameter with a default value of `None`
2. Creates a query object instead of immediately returning all results
3. Applies any filter conditions if they are provided
4. Returns all results after applying filters
5. Includes improved docstring with parameter and return value documentation

The implementation is consistent with the existing `search_invoices` method, but keeps the original method name and error handling. This way, existing code that calls `get_all_invoices()` without parameters will continue to work as before.

### Question:
can you give me examples of this filters argument? as much as possible, I want the filters to be not using the data object

### Answer:
I'll provide examples of how to create filters for the `get_all_invoices` method without directly using the data object. There are a few approaches you can use:

## Examples of Filter Arguments

### 1. Using SQLAlchemy Text Expressions

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import text

# Example usage:
filters = [
    text("invoice_number = :invoice_num").bindparams(invoice_num="INV-001"),
    text("total_amount > :min_amount").bindparams(min_amount=1000.0),
    text("date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date").bindparams(start_date='2023-01-01', end_date='2023-12-31')
]

invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
```

### 2. Using SQLAlchemy SQL Expression Language

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import and_, or_, func, column

# Example usage:
filters = [
    column('invoice_number') == 'INV-001',
    column('total_amount') > 1000.0,
    and_(
        func.date(column('date')) >= '2023-01-01',
        func.date(column('date')) <= '2023-12-31'
    )
]

invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
```

### 3. Using Raw SQL with SQLAlchemy

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
# Modify get_all_invoices to accept raw SQL conditions
def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None, raw_conditions=None):
    """Get all invoices with related data
    
    Args:
        filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions to apply. Defaults to None.
        raw_conditions (str, optional): Raw SQL WHERE clause. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        if raw_conditions:
            # Use raw SQL with SQLAlchemy
            return self.session.query(Invoice).from_statement(
                text(f"SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE {raw_conditions}")
            ).all()
        else:
            query = self.session.query(Invoice)
            
            if filters:
                for filter_condition in filters:
                    query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                    
            return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []

# Example usage:
raw_sql = "status = 'unpaid' AND total_amount > 500.0"
invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(raw_conditions=raw_sql)
```

### 4. Using Dictionary-Based Filters

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
# Modify get_all_invoices to accept dictionary filters
def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None, filter_dict=None):
    """Get all invoices with related data
    
    Args:
        filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions to apply. Defaults to None.
        filter_dict (dict, optional): Dictionary of column:value pairs to filter by. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        
        if filters:
            for filter_condition in filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
        
        if filter_dict:
            # Convert dictionary to filter conditions
            for column_name, value in filter_dict.items():
                # Handle special operators in column name (like column__gt for greater than)
                if '__' in column_name:
                    col_name, operator = column_name.split('__')
                    col = getattr(Invoice, col_name)
                    
                    if operator == 'gt':
                        query = query.filter(col > value)
                    elif operator == 'lt':
                        query = query.filter(col < value)
                    elif operator == 'gte':
                        query = query.filter(col >= value)
                    elif operator == 'lte':
                        query = query.filter(col <= value)
                    elif operator == 'like':
                        query = query.filter(col.like(f'%{value}%'))
                else:
                    # Simple equality
                    query = query.filter(getattr(Invoice, column_name) == value)
                    
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []

# Example usage:
filter_dict = {
    'status': 'unpaid',
    'total_amount__gt': 1000.0,
    'invoice_number__like': 'INV-2023'
}
invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filter_dict=filter_dict)
```

### 5. Using a Custom Filter Builder Function

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import and_, or_, func, column, table

def build_filter(column_name, value, operator='='):
    """Build a filter condition without using the data object directly
    
    Args:
        column_name (str): Name of the column
        value: Value to filter by
        operator (str): Comparison operator ('=', '>', '<', 'LIKE', etc.)
        
    Returns:
        SQLAlchemy filter condition
    """
    col = column(column_name)
    
    if operator == '=':
        return col == value
    elif operator == '>':
        return col > value
    elif operator == '<':
        return col < value
    elif operator == '>=':
        return col >= value
    elif operator == '<=':
        return col <= value
    elif operator.upper() == 'LIKE':
        return col.like(f'%{value}%')
    elif operator.upper() == 'IN':
        return col.in_(value)
    elif operator.upper() == 'BETWEEN':
        # value should be a tuple of (start, end)
        return and_(col >= value[0], col <= value[1])
    else:
        # Default to equality
        return col == value

# Example usage:
filters = [
    build_filter('invoice_number', 'INV-001'),
    build_filter('total_amount', 1000.0, '>'),
    build_filter('date', ('2023-01-01', '2023-12-31'), 'BETWEEN'),
    build_filter('status', 'unpaid')
]

invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
```

These examples provide different approaches to creating filters without directly using the data object. The best approach depends on your specific requirements and preferences. The dictionary-based approach (#4) and the custom filter builder function (#5) are particularly flexible and can be used without knowledge of the underlying data object structure.

### Question:
In the 1st and 2nd option you provided, can you show me an example using 'like' operator

### Answer:
I'll show you examples of using the 'LIKE' operator with both the SQLAlchemy Text Expressions and the SQLAlchemy SQL Expression Language approaches.

### 1. Using SQLAlchemy Text Expressions with LIKE operator

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import text

# Example using LIKE operator with text expressions
filters = [
    # Search for invoice numbers containing "INV-2023"
    text("invoice_number LIKE :invoice_pattern").bindparams(invoice_pattern="%INV-2023%"),
    
    # Search for descriptions containing "maintenance"
    text("description LIKE :desc_pattern").bindparams(desc_pattern="%maintenance%"),
    
    # Case-insensitive search (using lower function)
    text("LOWER(status) LIKE :status_pattern").bindparams(status_pattern="%paid%")
]

# Get invoices matching the LIKE patterns
invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
```

### 2. Using SQLAlchemy SQL Expression Language with LIKE operator

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import and_, or_, func, column

# Example using LIKE operator with SQL Expression Language
filters = [
    # Search for invoice numbers containing "INV-2023"
    column('invoice_number').like('%INV-2023%'),
    
    # Search for descriptions containing "maintenance"
    column('description').like('%maintenance%'),
    
    # Case-insensitive search using func.lower
    func.lower(column('status')).like('%paid%'),
    
    # Multiple conditions with OR
    or_(
        column('invoice_number').like('INV-2023-%'),
        column('invoice_number').like('QUOTE-2023-%')
    ),
    
    # Combining LIKE with other conditions
    and_(
        column('description').like('%service%'),
        column('total_amount') > 500.0
    )
]

# Get invoices matching the LIKE patterns
invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
```

Both approaches allow you to use the LIKE operator for pattern matching in your queries without directly referencing the Invoice data object. The text expression approach is more string-based, while the SQL expression language approach provides a more object-oriented interface to build your queries.

### Question:
In the #2 option, can you show me an example where the filters are applied to the Invoice.customer where customer is defined by a relationship

### Answer:
I'll show you how to apply filters to the `Invoice.customer` relationship using SQLAlchemy SQL Expression Language (option #2). Since we want to avoid directly using the data object, we'll need to use joins in our query.

### Using SQLAlchemy SQL Expression Language with Joins for Related Entities

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import and_, or_, func, column, table, join, select
from sqlalchemy.orm import aliased

def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None, customer_filters=None):
    """Get all invoices with related data and optional filtering on customer attributes
    
    Args:
        filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions for invoices. Defaults to None.
        customer_filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions for related customers. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        # Start with a basic query
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        
        # Apply invoice filters
        if filters:
            for filter_condition in filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
        
        # Apply customer filters if provided
        if customer_filters:
            # Join with customers table
            query = query.join(Invoice.customer)
            
            # Apply each customer filter
            for filter_condition in customer_filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []

# Example usage:
# Filters for the invoice table
invoice_filters = [
    column('total_amount') > 1000.0,
    column('status') == 'unpaid'
]

# Filters for the customer table
customer_filters = [
    # Filter customers with names containing "Corp"
    column('customers.name').like('%Corp%'),
    
    # Filter customers from a specific city
    column('customers.city') == 'New York',
    
    # Filter customers with email from a specific domain
    column('customers.email').like('%@example.com')
]

# Get invoices with both invoice and customer filters applied
invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(
    filters=invoice_filters,
    customer_filters=customer_filters
)
```

### Alternative Approach Using Raw SQL Joins

If you prefer to avoid using the relationship directly, you can use raw SQL joins:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import text

def get_invoices_with_customer_filters(self, invoice_filters=None, customer_filters=None):
    """Get invoices with filters on both invoice and customer tables using raw SQL
    
    Args:
        invoice_filters (list, optional): Raw SQL conditions for invoices. Defaults to None.
        customer_filters (list, optional): Raw SQL conditions for customers. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        # Build the SQL query
        sql = """
        SELECT i.* FROM invoices i
        JOIN customers c ON i.customer_id = c.id
        WHERE 1=1
        """
        
        params = {}
        
        # Add invoice filters
        if invoice_filters:
            for i, condition in enumerate(invoice_filters):
                sql += f" AND {condition['sql']}"
                params.update(condition['params'])
        
        # Add customer filters
        if customer_filters:
            for i, condition in enumerate(customer_filters):
                sql += f" AND {condition['sql']}"
                params.update(condition['params'])
        
        # Execute the query
        result = self.session.query(Invoice).from_statement(text(sql).params(**params)).all()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting invoices with customer filters: {str(e)}")
        return []

# Example usage:
invoice_filters = [
    {'sql': 'i.total_amount > :min_amount', 'params': {'min_amount': 1000.0}},
    {'sql': 'i.status = :status', 'params': {'status': 'unpaid'}}
]

customer_filters = [
    {'sql': 'c.name LIKE :customer_name', 'params': {'customer_name': '%Corp%'}},
    {'sql': 'c.city = :city', 'params': {'city': 'New York'}}
]

invoices = invoice_dao.get_invoices_with_customer_filters(
    invoice_filters=invoice_filters,
    customer_filters=customer_filters
)
```

### Using Column References Without Direct Relationship Access

If you want to avoid using the relationship but still use SQLAlchemy's expression language:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from sqlalchemy import and_, column, table

def get_all_invoices_with_customer_filters(self, invoice_filters=None, customer_filters=None):
    """Get all invoices with customer filters using table and column references
    
    Args:
        invoice_filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions for invoices. Defaults to None.
        customer_filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions for customers. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        # Define table references
        invoices_table = table('invoices')
        customers_table = table('customers')
        
        # Start with a basic query
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        
        # Join with customers table
        query = query.join(customers_table, 
                          invoices_table.c.customer_id == customers_table.c.id)
        
        # Apply invoice filters
        if invoice_filters:
            for filter_condition in invoice_filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
        
        # Apply customer filters
        if customer_filters:
            for filter_condition in customer_filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting invoices with customer filters: {str(e)}")
        return []

# Example usage:
invoice_filters = [
    column('invoices.total_amount') > 1000.0,
    column('invoices.status') == 'unpaid'
]

customer_filters = [
    column('customers.name').like('%Corp%'),
    column('customers.city') == 'New York'
]

invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices_with_customer_filters(
    invoice_filters=invoice_filters,
    customer_filters=customer_filters
)
```

These examples show different ways to filter invoices based on customer attributes without directly using the data object relationships in your filter conditions. The approach you choose depends on your specific requirements and preferences for query construction.

### Question:
In the get_all_invoices, one of the filters is like this func.lower(column('customer.name')).like(f'%{customer_name}%'). Can you modify the get_all_invoices to take apply this filter?

### Answer:
I'll modify the `get_all_invoices` method to handle customer-related filters, including the specific case of a case-insensitive search on customer name using `func.lower`.

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from src.dao.data_access_object import DataAccessObject
from src.do.invoice import Invoice
from sqlalchemy import func, column

def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None, customer_name=None):
    """Get all invoices with related data
    
    Args:
        filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions for invoices. Defaults to None.
        customer_name (str, optional): Customer name to search for (case-insensitive). Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        query = query.join(Invoice.customer)
        
        # Apply case-insensitive customer name filter if provided
        if customer_name:
            # Using the Customer model through the relationship
            query = query.filter(func.lower(Invoice.customer.name).like(f'%{customer_name.lower()}%'))
            
        # Apply other invoice filters
        if filters:
            for filter_condition in filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

However, I notice that this approach directly uses the relationship, which you wanted to avoid. Let's modify it to use a more generic approach with column references:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python
from src.dao.data_access_object import DataAccessObject
from src.do.invoice import Invoice
from sqlalchemy import func, text

def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None, customer_name=None):
    """Get all invoices with related data
    
    Args:
        filters (list, optional): List of filter conditions for invoices. Defaults to None.
        customer_name (str, optional): Customer name to search for (case-insensitive). Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        list: List of Invoice objects
    """
    try:
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        query = query.join(Invoice.customer)
        
        # Apply case-insensitive customer name filter if provided
        if customer_name:
            # Using text expression to avoid direct model reference
            query = query.filter(text("LOWER(customers.name) LIKE :name_pattern").bindparams(
                name_pattern=f"%{customer_name.lower()}%"))
            
        # Apply other invoice filters
        if filters:
            for filter_condition in filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

If you want to make it even more flexible to handle various customer-related filters, here's a more comprehensive approach:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\dao\invoice_dao.py**
```python

#

```

This approach allows you to pass in separate filters for the invoice and customer tables, giving you more flexibility in how you construct your queries. The customer name filter is implemented using a text expression to avoid direct model references, as requested.

### Question:
Why can't I use column('customer.name') in the filters ?

### Answer:
You can't use `column('customer.name')` directly in the filters because of how SQLAlchemy processes column references. Let me explain the issues and provide solutions:

### Why `column('customer.name')` Doesn't Work

1. **Dot Notation Confusion**: When you use `column('customer.name')`, SQLAlchemy interprets this as looking for a single column literally named "customer.name", not as "the name column in the customer table".

2. **Table Qualification**: In SQL, when you want to refer to a column in a specific table, you use the syntax `table_name.column_name`. SQLAlchemy's `column()` function doesn't automatically handle this table qualification properly when given as a single string with a dot.

3. **Ambiguity in Joins**: When joining tables, column names need to be properly qualified to avoid ambiguity, especially if both tables have columns with the same name.

### Solutions to Use Customer Name in Filters

#### 1. Use Separate Table and Column References

```python
from sqlalchemy import column, table

# Define the customers table
customers = table('customers', column('id'), column('name'))

# Now use the table's column in your filter
customer_filter = customers.c.name.like('%Company%')
```

#### 2. Use Text Expression (Most Reliable)

```python
from sqlalchemy import text

# Using text expression with explicit table qualification
customer_filter = text("customers.name LIKE :name_pattern").bindparams(
    name_pattern="%Company%")
```

#### 3. Use Proper Column Qualification

```python
from sqlalchemy import column

# Correctly reference the column with table qualification
customer_filter = column('customers.name').like('%Company%')
```

This approach can work in some cases, but it's less reliable than the other methods because SQLAlchemy might still interpret it incorrectly.

#### 4. Use the Model's Attribute (If Available)

```python
from src.do.customer import Customer

# Using the model's attribute (this uses the data object directly)
customer_filter = Customer.name.like('%Company%')
```

### Best Practice for Your Case

Since you want to avoid using the data object directly, the most reliable approach is to use the text expression method:

```python
from sqlalchemy import text

# In your InvoiceDao class
def get_all_invoices(self, filters=None):
    try:
        query = self.session.query(Invoice)
        query = query.join(Invoice.customer)
        
        # Apply invoice filters
        if filters:
            for filter_condition in filters:
                query = query.filter(filter_condition)
                
        return query.all()
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error getting all invoices: {str(e)}")
        return []

# When calling the method
customer_name_filter = text("LOWER(customers.name) LIKE :name_pattern").bindparams(
    name_pattern=f"%{customer_name.lower()}%")

invoices = invoice_dao.get_all_invoices(filters=[customer_name_filter])
```

This approach:
1. Explicitly qualifies the column with the table name
2. Uses parameter binding for security
3. Doesn't rely on direct data object references
4. Works reliably with joins

If you need to build these filters dynamically, you can create a helper function:

```python
def build_customer_filter(field, value, operator='LIKE'):
    if operator.upper() == 'LIKE':
        return text(f"LOWER(customers.{field}) LIKE :value").bindparams(
            value=f"%{value.lower()}%")
    else:
        return text(f"customers.{field} {operator} :value").bindparams(
            value=value)

# Usage
filters = [
    build_customer_filter('name', 'company'),
    build_customer_filter('city', 'New York', '=')
]
```

This gives you a flexible way to build customer filters without directly using the data objects.

### Question:
Can you refactor data() in the InvoicesModel such I capitalize the colum names and remove only some columns?

### Answer:
I'll refactor the `data()` method in the `InvoicesModel` class to capitalize column names and include only specific columns. I'll also make the code more maintainable by using a mapping approach instead of a long if-elif chain.

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\models\invoices_model.py**
```python
def data(self, index, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
    if not index.isValid() or not (0 <= index.row() < len(self.invoices)):
        return None

    invoice = self.invoices[index.row()]

    if role == Qt.DisplayRole:
        # Define column mappings with formatting functions
        column_mappings = {
            0: lambda inv: inv.id,
            1: lambda inv: inv.invoice_number.upper(),  # Capitalize invoice number
            2: lambda inv: inv.date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            3: lambda inv: inv.customer.name.title() if inv.customer else "",  # Capitalize customer name
            4: lambda inv: f"{inv.total_amount:.2f}",
            5: lambda inv: inv.status.capitalize()  # Capitalize status
        }
        
        # Return formatted data if column is in our mappings
        if index.column() in column_mappings:
            return column_mappings[index.column()](invoice)

    return None
```

If you want to remove specific columns, you'll need to update both the `headers` list in `__init__` and the `data()` method. Here's how to modify the class to show only ID, Invoice Number, Customer, and Total Amount:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\models\invoices_model.py**
```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QAbstractTableModel, Qt, QModelIndex

from src.dao.invoice_dao import InvoiceDao

class InvoicesModel(QAbstractTableModel):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.dao = InvoiceDao()
        self.invoices = []
        # Reduced headers list - removed Date and Status
        self.headers = ["ID", "Invoice Number", "Customer", "Total Amount"]
        self.load_data()

    def load_data(self, filters=None):
        self.invoices = self.dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
        print(self.invoices)
        self.layoutChanged.emit()

    # retained to differentiate between initial load and data update
    def update(self, filters=None):
        self.load_data(filters)

    def rowCount(self, parent=QModelIndex()):
        return len(self.invoices)

    def columnCount(self, parent=QModelIndex()):
        return len(self.headers)

    def data(self, index, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
        if not index.isValid() or not (0 <= index.row() < len(self.invoices)):
            return None

        invoice = self.invoices[index.row()]

        if role == Qt.DisplayRole:
            # Define column mappings with formatting functions
            # Note: Column indices are now different since we removed some columns
            column_mappings = {
                0: lambda inv: inv.id,
                1: lambda inv: inv.invoice_number.upper(),  # Capitalize invoice number
                2: lambda inv: inv.customer.name.title() if inv.customer else "",  # Capitalize customer name
                3: lambda inv: f"{inv.total_amount:.2f}"
            }
            
            # Return formatted data if column is in our mappings
            if index.column() in column_mappings:
                return column_mappings[index.column()](invoice)

    def headerData(self, section, orientation, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
        if orientation == Qt.Horizontal and role == Qt.DisplayRole:
            return self.headers[section]
        return None
```

If you want to keep all columns but just capitalize the values, here's that version:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\models\invoices_model.py**
```python
def data(self, index, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
    if not index.isValid() or not (0 <= index.row() < len(self.invoices)):
        return None

    invoice = self.invoices[index.row()]

    if role == Qt.DisplayRole:
        # Define column mappings with formatting functions
        column_mappings = {
            0: lambda inv: inv.id,
            1: lambda inv: inv.invoice_number.upper(),  # Capitalize invoice number
            2: lambda inv: inv.date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            3: lambda inv: inv.customer.name.title() if inv.customer else "",  # Title case customer name
            4: lambda inv: f"{inv.total_amount:.2f}",
            5: lambda inv: inv.status.capitalize()  # Capitalize first letter of status
        }
        
        # Return formatted data if column is in our mappings
        if index.column() in column_mappings:
            return column_mappings[index.column()](invoice)

    return None
```

This refactored approach:
1. Makes the code more maintainable by using a dictionary mapping instead of a long if-elif chain
2. Applies appropriate capitalization to text fields
3. Provides a clear structure that makes it easy to add, remove, or modify columns
4. Maintains the same functionality while being more concise

Choose the version that best fits your requirements for which columns to display and how to format them.

### Question:
What I i just want to display self.invoices as is except for the created_at column

### Answer:
If you want to display all columns from `self.invoices` except for the `created_at` column, you can modify the `InvoicesModel` class to dynamically generate the headers and column mappings based on the attributes of the `Invoice` object. Here's how you can refactor the code:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\models\invoices_model.py**
```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QAbstractTableModel, Qt, QModelIndex
from sqlalchemy.inspection import inspect
from src.dao.invoice_dao import InvoiceDao
from src.do.invoice import Invoice

class InvoicesModel(QAbstractTableModel):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.dao = InvoiceDao()
        self.invoices = []
        
        # Get all column names from the Invoice model except 'created_at'
        self.excluded_columns = ['created_at']
        self.column_names = [c.name for c in inspect(Invoice).columns 
                            if c.name not in self.excluded_columns]
        
        # Format headers to be more readable (capitalize and replace underscores with spaces)
        self.headers = [name.replace('_', ' ').title() for name in self.column_names]
        
        self.load_data()

    def load_data(self, filters=None):
        self.invoices = self.dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
        print(self.invoices)
        self.layoutChanged.emit()

    # retained to differentiate between initial load and data update
    def update(self, filters=None):
        self.load_data(filters)

    def rowCount(self, parent=QModelIndex()):
        return len(self.invoices)

    def columnCount(self, parent=QModelIndex()):
        return len(self.headers)

    def data(self, index, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
        if not index.isValid() or not (0 <= index.row() < len(self.invoices)):
            return None

        invoice = self.invoices[index.row()]

        if role == Qt.DisplayRole:
            column_name = self.column_names[index.column()]
            
            # Handle special cases for formatting
            if column_name == 'date' or column_name == 'due_date':
                date_value = getattr(invoice, column_name)
                return date_value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") if date_value else ""
            
            elif column_name == 'customer_id':
                # Display customer name instead of ID if available
                return invoice.customer.name if hasattr(invoice, 'customer') and invoice.customer else str(invoice.customer_id)
            
            elif column_name in ['total_amount', 'subtotal', 'tax_amount']:
                # Format monetary values
                value = getattr(invoice, column_name)
                return f"{value:.2f}" if value is not None else "0.00"
            
            else:
                # Default handling for other attributes
                value = getattr(invoice, column_name)
                return str(value) if value is not None else ""

        return None

    def headerData(self, section, orientation, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
        if orientation == Qt.Horizontal and role == Qt.DisplayRole:
            return self.headers[section]
        return None
```

If you prefer to keep your existing column structure but just exclude `created_at`, here's a simpler approach:

**File: D:\ProgrammingPython\thanos_app\src\models\invoices_model.py**
```python
from PyQt5.QtCore import QAbstractTableModel, Qt, QModelIndex

from src.dao.invoice_dao import InvoiceDao

class InvoicesModel(QAbstractTableModel):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.dao = InvoiceDao()
        self.invoices = []
        self.headers = ["ID", "Invoice Number", "Date", "Customer", "Total Amount", "Status"]
        self.load_data()

    def load_data(self, filters=None):
        self.invoices = self.dao.get_all_invoices(filters)
        print(self.invoices)
        self.layoutChanged.emit()

    # retained to differentiate between initial load and data update
    def update(self, filters=None):
        self.load_data(filters)

    def rowCount(self, parent=QModelIndex()):
        return len(self.invoices)

    def columnCount(self, parent=QModelIndex()):
        return len(self.headers)

    def data(self, index, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
        if not index.isValid() or not (0 <= index.row() < len(self.invoices)):
            return None

        invoice = self.invoices[index.row()]

        if role == Qt.DisplayRole:
            # Define column mappings with formatting functions
            column_mappings = {
                0: lambda inv: inv.id,
                1: lambda inv: inv.invoice_number,
                2: lambda inv: inv.date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") if inv.date else "",
                3: lambda inv: inv.customer.name if hasattr(inv, 'customer') and inv.customer else "",  
                4: lambda inv: f"{inv.total_amount:.2f}" if inv.total_amount is not None else "0.00",
                5: lambda inv: inv.status if inv.status else ""
            }
        
            # Return formatted data if column is in our mappings
            if index.column() in column_mappings:
                return column_mappings[index.column()](invoice)

        return None

    def headerData(self, section, orientation, role=Qt.DisplayRole):
        if orientation == Qt.Horizontal and role == Qt.DisplayRole:
            return self.headers[section]
        return None
```

This second approach:
1. Keeps your existing column structure
2. Adds null checks to prevent errors
3. Formats dates and monetary values consistently
4. Ignores the `created_at` column by simply not including it in your column mappings

The first approach is more dynamic and will automatically adapt if you add or remove columns from your `Invoice` model, while the second approach gives you more explicit control over exactly which columns are displayed and how they're formatted.
