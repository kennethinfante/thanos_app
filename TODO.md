Bugs
    If I make changes, pressed cancel
        if no - I want the window to remain open
        if yes - when I open again the invoice, changes are still there
    If I make changes, close the window, when I open again the invoice, changes are still there
    If I change the Tax, and move arrow, it is cleared and set to nothing
    If I add a new line, the default tax is nothing, I want it to be 2
    
When deleting, I want the list of invoices in the invoice_list_manager to be updated
