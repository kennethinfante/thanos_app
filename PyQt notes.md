## Notes on UI

* For object_names, use `snake_case` except for the top-level in Qt Designer because that will be the class name
* For the top-level widget, it will be `camelCase`
* For action and menus, they are prefixed with `action` and `menu`. The rest, they are suffixed

* Some abbrev
    * hly - horizontal layout
    * vly - vertical layout
    * dte - date edit
    * lne - line edit
    * btn - button
    * chbox - checkbox
